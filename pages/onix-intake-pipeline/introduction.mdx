## OIP (Onix Intake Pipeline) System Overview

### Introduction
This document provides an overview of the Onix Intake Pipeline (OIP), detailing the system's purpose, architecture, and key components involved in processing and managing publisher metadata efficiently.

### System Purpose
The OIP is designed to streamline the ingestion, processing, and storage of JSON metadata files from publishers, ensuring high reliability and consistency across digital content management.

### Data Flow
Data flows through the system as follows:

<Steps>
  	<Step title="Metadata Reception">
    	Publisher metadata is received at the [Kafka Intake Queue](/onix-intake-pipeline/services/kafka-queue), which serves as the entry point for incoming JSON files.
  	</Step>
  	<Step title="Data Processing">
    	The [Onix Orchestration](/onix-intake-pipeline/services/onixedit-orchestration) service retrieves data from the Kafka Intake Queue, processes it to ensure validity and completeness, and updates the [MongoDB](/onix-intake-pipeline/databases/content-metadata) with new or updated entries.
  	</Step>
  	<Step title="Initiate Download">
    	Once the metadata update is confirmed, the Orchestration Service sends a download request to the [Content Fetcher](/onix-intake-pipeline/services/content-fetcher), specifying the files to be retrieved.
  	</Step>
  	<Step title="File Storage">
    	The Content Fetcher successfully downloads the files and securely stores them in the [Content File Server](/onix-intake-pipeline/databases/content-fs). It then confirms the completion of the download process back to the Onix Orchestration.
  	</Step>
	<Step title="Completion Confirmation">
    	The Onix Orchestration confirms the successful handling of each file by sending a completion signal back to the Kafka Queue, allowing the system to proceed with the next item.
	</Step>
</Steps>

### Technologies Used
The system utilizes Node.js for service implementations, Kafka for message queuing, MongoDB for metadata storage, and various file handling libraries for the Fetch Service.

### Security and Compliance
Security measures include data encryption in transit and at rest, use of HTTPS for all internal communications, and strict access controls on MongoDB and the file system.

### Scalability and Performance
The system is designed for high scalability to handle increasing loads seamlessly. Performance metrics include processing throughput and response times, monitored continuously to ensure optimal performance.
