## Overview

### Purpose of the File Server

The Content File Server is dedicated to the storage and management of digital assets related to the metadata processed by the Onix Orchestration system. It provides a secure and scalable environment for file storage, ensuring files are available for retrieval and distribution.

### High-Level Data Flow

Files are downloaded by the Content Fetcher service and stored on the server, where they are linked to their respective metadata entries in the Content Metadata database.

## Architecture

### Storage Design

The server is structured to handle various file types and sizes efficiently, optimizing storage and access speeds to meet the demands of high throughput and low latency file operations.

### Component Interaction

- **Content Fetcher**: Directly interacts with the server to store files after download.
- **Onix Orchestration**: Retrieves file locations for metadata updates and operational activities.

## Detailed Workflow


<Steps>
  <Step title="Store Files">
    Receives files from the Content Fetcher and securely stores them, organizing them according to metadata for easy retrieval.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Retrieve Files">
    Provides mechanisms for quick and secure file retrieval based on requests from authorized services and users.
  </Step>

## Technologies Used

- **File System**: Utilizes robust file system management technologies to organize and handle the storage of large amounts of data efficiently.
- **Azure Blob Storage (Blob)**: Acts like a Network Attached Storage (NAS) but is designed specifically for cloud environments. 
- **Azure CDN**: Integrates with Azure CDN to ensure fast delivery of content across global locations.

## Monitoring and Logging

Ensures continuous monitoring of system health and performance, with detailed logging of file access and changes to ensure auditability and compliance.

## Security Measures

- **Data Encryption**: Applies strong encryption protocols for files both at rest and during transfer.
- **Azure Security Features**: Leverages Azure's built-in security features to enhance the overall protection of stored data.
- **Access Controls**: Strict access controls and authentication mechanisms are in place to ensure that only authorized personnel and systems can access or modify the files.
