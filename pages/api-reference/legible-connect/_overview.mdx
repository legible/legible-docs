	Device connections rely on a two-part connection process. 
	PATCH requests are sent to the server to update the global user state, and the active application subscribing to the Server-Sent Events.

## Server-Sent Events

There are two ways to build API documentation: [OpenAPI](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/openapi/setup) and [MDX components](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/mdx/configuration). For the starter kit, we are using the following OpenAPI specification.

## REST API

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
