## Overview

### Purpose of the Service

The Content Fetcher service is responsible for downloading content files as requested by the Onix Orchestration service. It acts as a sink in the data pipeline, ensuring that files are retrieved and stored securely in the designated File System.

### High-Level Process Flow

This service manages the retrieval of digital content associated with metadata processed by the Onix Orchestration service, confirming successful downloads or logging failures.

## Architecture

### Service Design

The service is designed to handle high volumes of download requests concurrently, optimizing file transfer and minimizing latency.

## Detailed Workflow

### Receiving Download Commands

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive Requests">
    Accepts download requests from the Onix Orchestration service, including URLs and file metadata.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Queue Management">
    Manages a queue of download tasks to prioritize and handle them efficiently.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Executing Downloads

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Files">
    Initiates file downloads using HTTP or FTP protocols based on the provided URLs.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate Downloads">
    Validates the integrity of downloaded files through checksums or file size comparisons.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store Files">
    Saves the downloaded files to the designated File System, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Handling Responses

<Steps>
  <Step title="Notify Success">
    Sends success notifications back to the Onix Orchestration service to confirm the completion of downloads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Error Handling">
    Reports any failures in the download process back to the Onix Orchestration service for logging and potential retry.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: For handling asynchronous file downloads and network operations.
- **Axios**: For HTTP requests to download files.
- **File System API**: For storing and managing files on the server.

## Monitoring and Logging

Comprehensive logging is implemented to track download progress, success rates, and any errors encountered during the download process.

## Security Measures

- **Data Encryption**: Ensures that all file transfers are encrypted using industry-standard protocols.
- **Access Controls**: Implements strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to the downloaded files.
